      so we've created a container. the first question is *what* are we 
      centering. are we "centering a `<div>`"? some might say that it is plain 
      that we are, but what does this statement mean? is a "`<div>`" is tag or 
      its element? surely, one could easily "center a `<div>`" this way:

      ```
        the developer's monitor:
          _________________________________________________
          |_ some editor __________________________________|
          | </head>                                        |
          | <body class="fancy web app">                   |
          |                     <div>                      |
          |                     </div>                     |
          | </body>                                        |
          | </html>                                        |
          |                                                |
          |                                                |
          |                                                |
          |                                                |

      but obviously this just won't do; the developer may have completely 
      misunderstood what it means to design a page using style. we expect the 
      HTML tags and the CSS selectors to be combined in a special way by the 
      browser and applied together. but in that combination we find that we 
      are not merely "centering a `<div>`", but centering *something* whatever 
      a `<div>` may be adequate to represent either in the application or 
      presentation layer (OSI), or adaptive semiotic (semantic layer of 
      the OSI model). what do we want to see on a screen, an apple? then 
      perhaps a `<div>` is fitting, but a modal window? most probably we 
      may find ourselves "centering" a `<dialog>` or something else, 
      and the way we go about it will certainly assume certain capabilities
      of the device capable, supposedly, of receiving such presentation 
      layer code that it actually renders in some obviously correct output.
      `position`? `transform`? what's sufficient?
    -->

      <div class="centered-div">
        cats
      </div>

    <!--
      with something as simple as the above we see that the problem isn't 
      achieving the "centering" of a "`<div>`" but rather the consequence of 
      centering a `<div>` in such a way as that which uses the `position` 
      property. but must we use the position property?
    -->

      <div class="centered-div-without-position">
        <div>dogs</div>
      </div>

    <!--
      there are a couple of things to notice here; namely, the existing 
      `.centered-div` solution has been unaffected, and secondly the 
      non-position-al solution requires a lot more code. or does it? 
      it's one more line, and really, the `html`, `body` and `.container` 
      could all technically be expressed in one line as a "setup" for this
      strategy itself. in any case, we call for flex, but fewer properties, 
      not needing to set the `width` at all, obviously.
    -->

    <!--
      why should we choose one over the other? well, one has wider browder support.
      and they both avoid using JavaScript. but why shouldn't we use JavaScript, or 
      rather, whichever method that we decide to use, is it important to figure out 
      if it works with JavaScript under the right circumstances, and if so, are some 
      of those circumstances ruling out of certain CSS properties for performance or 
      capability reasons.
    -->

    <!--
      but then there's the meaning of the style itself. what is "flex" 
      supposedly "flexing"? is it the box model, is it the element itself? the 
      DOM? is it the actual tag on your screen in accordance with your visual 
      intuition? what's the physics by which flex-ation is measured such that i 
      can determine how the interactions of other elements will play out? is 
      "physics" even the right conceptual scheme to deploy when understanding 
      these elements? when i say "the `<div>` there" do i mean to imply an 
      object that obeys the DOM, HTML, my intuition, the design or style guide, 
      the physical laws of nature or the norms of typesetting? particularly 
      when i say "center" it? is centering a `<div>` like how god would center 
      an apple, with `position` or would god `flex` out the environment? where,
      and why? these are the kinds of questions we may wonder: do we "center" a 
      modal window by positioning it, or by adapting the environment to let it 
      center like a text object? is a modal window more like a text object or 
      something that you `position` like you would a physical object in JS?
      these are the fundamental questions relating to "what" it is that is being 
      centered before we decide "how" it is we go about "centering a `<div>`"
    -->

    <!--
      aside from the wildly interpretative agreement that is required to even 
      say which "say" counts as the quintessential one. should the solution
      basically adapt to the page? should there be side-effects, like overflowing
      the page? perhaps in a physical environment, such information is relevant, 
      where in a "document flow" (DOM) style setting, such physical information 
      would represent a broken page or disrupted document flow algorithm. but there 
      are many: flow, `flex`, `grid`, those implicit in the likes of `<table>` 
      and `<ul>`; none of which behave like a `position: relative` in its 
      relation to its parent `position: absolute`, except maybe sometimes: 
      flex items will appear inside their parent by their left and right 
      position are usually defined with priority relative to each other rather 
      than to their parent.

      and nothing, by the way, says we cannot add a `<div>` in order to achieve 
      centering "a `<div>`"; why should one element by necessary and 
      sufficient for the task? what if another element adequately expresses 
      the complexity of the concept being represented? is the extra element 
      really a cost, anyway? could we not apply the solution itself without the 
      extra element anyway, applying `flex` to the `.container`? would the other 
      solution be in disrepair if so? how to emend, if so?

      obviously with `.centered-div` we can use `margin-left` and so on to offset its
      visible position according to its designated width: but what is its width? why 
      768 or 1024 or anything for that matter? this will usually come from requirements 
      or the physical assumptions. often times developers will "center" through 
      `margin: 0 auto` since this algorithm is implicit in this problem.
